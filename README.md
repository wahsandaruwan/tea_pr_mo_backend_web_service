helpers/: Dedicated to custom helper functions or modules that assist in specific tasks like string manipulation, date formatting, validation, error handling, etc. This helps keep the codebase clean and reusable.
utils/: Reserved for general-purpose utility functions or modules that are more broadly applicable across the application, including things like authentication helpers, logging utilities, configuration handlers, etc.
controllers/: Contains modules responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing input data, interacting with models, and returning appropriate responses. These often make use of helpers or utilities for additional functionalities.
models/: Where you define your application's data models or interact with the database. This folder might contain files representing different database models.
routes/: Houses the route definitions for the application, separating the endpoint definitions from the logic that handles these endpoints in controllers.
config/: Stores configuration files for the application, including environment-specific configurations, constants, or settings used throughout the project.
app.js: Entry point of the application where you set up the server, define middleware, and connect routes and controllers.
